# WebMeter

This repository is for storing some interesting WebGL animations I've come across to be used for background animations. Each animation has two folders, Interface and Template. The animation in Interface puts a GUI overlay so that you can actively play with settings. Template only contains the animation, so it can be used as a background. Template also contains a file called webmeter.js, which you can set to your desired settings.
